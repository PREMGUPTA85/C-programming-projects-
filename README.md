# 🚀 Daily C++ Practice

Welcome to my **Daily C++ Practice Repository**!  
I upload one C++ program every day to build strong coding habits, improve logical thinking, and master C++ step-by-step.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- ✅ Code consistently every day
- ✅ Strengthen core C++ concepts
- ✅ Track my progress and growth
- ✅ Prepare for interviews and competitive programming

---


Each folder contains one C++ program related to a specific topic.

## 🛠️ How to Run the Code

> Make sure you have a C++ compiler like `g++` installed.

1. Open terminal or command prompt  
2. Navigate to the day's folder:

```bash
cd Day01
```

Compile and run:
```
g++ program.cpp -o output
./output
```
